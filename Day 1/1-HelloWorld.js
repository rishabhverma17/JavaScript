JavaScript is a high level, dynamic, interpreted programming language. Along with HTML and CSS, it's one of the three essential technologies used in Web content production. The majority of websites employ JavaScript, and it's supported by all modern web browsers without plugins.

Here is a sample line of code that can be executed in Javascript:

console.log("Hello World!");
You can also store a string in a variable and print it:

var my_string = "Hello World!";
console.log(my_string);
Try it out! Write a function that prints Hello World in the console below.

function processData(input) {
    //Enter your code here
    console.log("Hello World!");
}
